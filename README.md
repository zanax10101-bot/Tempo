## 🎯 What is Tempo?

Tempo helps students manage their time, tasks, and habits in one beautiful, free app. No more juggling Google Calendar, Todoist, Forest, and three other apps.

### Why Tempo?
- **Student-first**: Built around academic life, not adapted from business tools
- **Truly free**: All core features free forever. Only cloud sync is paid.
- **Focused**: Not trying to be Notion. Just the tools you need, done well.
