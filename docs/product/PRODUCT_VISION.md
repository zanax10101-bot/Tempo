## 🏆 Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses (Our Opportunity) |
|------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Todoist** | Excellent task management, clean UI | No timer, no habits, student features paywalled |
| **Google Calendar** | Ubiquitous, free | Just a calendar—no tasks, timers, or habits |
| **Habitica** | Gamified habits | Overwhelming UI, feels childish for older students |
| **Forest** | Great focus timer | One-trick pony, no task integration |
| **Notion** | Infinitely flexible | Too complex, steep learning curve |

**Our Position**: The best of Todoist's task management + Forest's focus timers + student-specific features, all free and beautifully integrated.
