## Our Competitive Advantages

### 1. **Truly Free**
Competitors either charge upfront or lock key features behind paywalls. We're free forever for all core features.

### 2. **Student-First**
We're not adapting a business tool for students. We're building FOR students from day one.

### 3. **Integrated Experience**
Timer that knows your tasks. Tasks that track your time. Calendar that shows your habits. One app, one workflow.

### 4. **No Bloat**
We're not trying to be Notion. We're focused on the tools students actually use daily.

## Risks & Threats

1. **Todoist adds timer**: They have resources to build anything
2. **Forest adds tasks**: Natural expansion for them
3. **Notion AI**: Could auto-generate productivity features
4. **New entrants**: Low barrier to entry for web apps

**Mitigation**: Move fast, nail the student experience, build community early.
