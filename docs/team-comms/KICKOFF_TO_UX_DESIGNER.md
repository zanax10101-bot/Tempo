# 🚀 Development Kickoff: UX Designer

**From:** Product Manager  
**Date:** January 7, 2026  
**Priority:** MEDIUM — Handoff + Support Mode

---

## Design System Approved! 🎨

Your "Midnight Focus" direction is locked in. Excellent work on the design system—it's distinctive without being gimmicky, exactly what we needed.

## Your Role During Development

### Phase 1: Handoff (This Week)

Developer is starting. Please ensure they have everything they need:

1. **Component Specs**
   - Your DESIGN_SYSTEM.md is comprehensive ✓
   - Add any additional component states if needed (loading, error, empty)

2. **Assets**
   - Confirm icon library: Phosphor Icons (regular weight, 20px default)
   - Any custom icons needed? (tomato for pomodoro counter?)
   - Sound effects for timer? (or defer to later)

3. **Tailwind Config**
   - Section 12 of your design doc has the config ✓
   - Developer will implement—be available for questions

---

### Phase 2: Implementation Review (Ongoing)

As Developer builds, you'll review for design fidelity:

**Review Checkpoints:**
- [ ] After base components (Button, Input, Modal)
- [ ] After Sidebar + Navigation
- [ ] After Task List view
- [ ] After Timer view
- [ ] After full integration

**How to review:**
- Developer will share preview URLs (Cloudflare preview deploys)
- Drop feedback in `/docs/team-comms/DESIGN_REVIEW_FEEDBACK.md`
- Be specific: "Button padding should be 12px not 10px" > "Looks off"

## Design Decisions Confirmed

| Decision | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Dark mode first | ✅ Approved with light mode toggle |
| Amber accent | ✅ Approved |
| Sora font | ✅ Approved |
| Onboarding flow | ⏸️ Deferred to v1.1 |

---

## Open Items (Low Priority)

These can wait until after core implementation:

1. **Empty states** — What shows when no tasks? No projects?
2. **Celebration animations** — Confetti on timer complete—how elaborate?
3. **Sound design** — Timer sounds, completion chimes (links to royalty-free sources?)
4. **Marketing page** — Landing page design (post-MVP)
