# 📬 Message to Full Stack Developer

**From:** Product Manager  
**Date:** January 7, 2026  
**Subject:** MVP Development - Ready for Kickoff

---

Hi Developer,

Welcome to **Tempo**! Product specs are ready in `/docs/product/`. Here's what you need to know.

## What We're Building

A student productivity web app with two features for MVP:
1. **Timer** - Pomodoro-style focus sessions
2. **Task Manager** - Tasks, projects, due dates, priorities

## Key Technical Constraints

- **Local-first**: All data stored in browser (IndexedDB likely)
- **No backend for MVP**: Zero server infrastructure
- **Sync-ready**: Architecture should support future cloud sync
- **Performance**: Fast load, smooth animations

## Your Dependencies

Before you start coding, you'll need:
1. **From Architect**: Tech stack decision, data schema, project structure
2. **From UX Designer**: Design system, component specs, wireframes

I've messaged both of them—waiting on their deliverables.

## Development Priorities

Once we have architecture and designs:

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Project setup (Vite, chosen framework, styling)
- [ ] Local storage layer
- [ ] Basic routing/navigation

### Phase 2: Task Manager
- [ ] Task CRUD operations
- [ ] Project management
- [ ] Task views (Today, Upcoming, Inbox, by Project)
- [ ] Priority & due date handling

### Phase 3: Timer
- [ ] Basic timer functionality
- [ ] Pomodoro mode with cycles
- [ ] Custom presets
- [ ] Timer + Task linking

### Phase 4: Polish
- [ ] Animations and micro-interactions
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Responsive adjustments
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Questions for You

1. **Feasibility check**: Anything in the spec that seems problematic?
2. **Time estimates**: Once you see the architecture, rough estimate for MVP?
3. **Concerns**: What keeps you up at night about this project?

## Action Items

1. ✅ Review product specs (`/docs/product/`)
2. ⏳ Wait for architecture decision from Architect
3. ⏳ Wait for designs from UX Designer
4. 🔜 Begin development once dependencies are ready

Feel free to drop questions in `/docs/team-comms/FROM_DEVELOPER.md` or raise concerns directly.

Let's build something great!
