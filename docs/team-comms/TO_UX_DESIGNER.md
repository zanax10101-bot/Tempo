# 📬 Message to UX Designer

**From:** Product Manager  
**Date:** January 7, 2026  
**Subject:** MVP Design Direction Needed

---

Hi UX Designer,

I've completed the product spec for **Tempo** (see `/docs/product/`). Before development starts, I need your design expertise.

## Product Context

- **What**: Productivity app for students (Timer + Task Manager for MVP)
- **Who**: Students (high school through graduate)
- **Competition**: Todoist, Forest, Notion
- **Vibe**: Modern, focused, NOT generic "AI slop"

## Design Questions

### 1. Visual Direction
What aesthetic should we pursue? Some ideas:
- **Clean minimal** (like Linear, Things 3)
- **Playful but mature** (like Notion, Craft)
- **Dark/focused** (like Obsidian)
- **Warm and inviting** (like Todoist)

Students range from 14-35, so we need something that doesn't feel childish but isn't corporate either.

### 2. Color Palette
- Should we go light mode default, dark mode default, or system preference?
- Primary brand color thoughts? (avoiding the cliché purple gradient)
- How do we use color for priority levels without looking like a stoplight?

### 3. Typography
We want distinctive but readable. Suggestions?
- System fonts for performance?
- A character font that stands out?
- Different fonts for headings vs body?

### 4. Component Library Decision
Should we:
- Use an existing library (Radix, shadcn/ui, Headless UI)?
- Build custom components?
- Hybrid approach?

Constraint: We don't have illustrators, so we'll use icon libraries and avoid custom illustrations.

### 5. Key Screens to Design
For MVP, we need:
1. **Main dashboard/home**
2. **Task list view** (with projects sidebar)
3. **Task detail/edit modal**
4. **Timer view** (full focus mode)
5. **Timer running state** (maybe compact mode in corner?)
6. **Settings**

### 6. Timer UX Specifics
- How prominent should the timer be when running?
- Full-screen focus mode vs floating timer?
- What makes a timer completion feel satisfying?

### 7. Mobile Consideration
MVP is desktop-first, but should be usable on mobile. How do we handle:
- Task quick-add on mobile?
- Timer on mobile?

## Deliverables Requested

Please provide:
1. **Moodboard or style direction** (can be references to existing apps)
2. **Color palette proposal**
3. **Typography recommendation**
4. **Component library recommendation**
5. **Wireframes for key screens** (low-fi is fine to start)

Drop your work in `/docs/design/` when ready.

Looking forward to seeing your vision!
