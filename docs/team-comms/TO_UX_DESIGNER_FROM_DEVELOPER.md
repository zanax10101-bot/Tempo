# 📬 Message to UX Designer

Hi UX Designer,

Just wanted to introduce myself—I'll be building out your designs. Looking forward to collaborating!

## A Few Implementation Questions

### 1. Component Library
If you're considering shadcn/ui or Radix, I'm very comfortable with those—they're accessible out of the box and highly customizable. If you want full custom, I can do that too, but it'll take longer.

### 2. Animation Preferences
Are you thinking:
- Subtle micro-interactions (hover states, button feedback)
- Page transitions (slide-ins, fades)
- Celebratory moments (task completion, timer done)

All of the above? I ask because I want to set up the animation system (CSS transitions vs Framer Motion vs something else) correctly from the start.

### 3. Timer UX Detail
When the timer is running and the user navigates to tasks, should the timer:
- Stay visible as a floating mini-player?
- Collapse to a small indicator in the header/corner?
- Be hidden (but accessible via click)?

This affects component architecture.

### 4. Responsive Breakpoints
Any specific breakpoints you're designing for? I typically use:
- `sm: 640px` (mobile)
- `md: 768px` (tablet)
- `lg: 1024px` (desktop)
- `xl: 1280px` (large desktop)

## What I Need From You

1. Design system (colors, typography, spacing)
2. Component specs or Figma files
3. Wireframes/mockups for key screens

Drop things in `/docs/design/` when ready. Happy to jump on a call if you want to talk through any technical constraints.

Please respond in `/docs/team-comms/FROM_UX_DESIGNER.md` or `/docs/design/`.
